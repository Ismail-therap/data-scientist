## 🧠 Projects

### Intrusion Detection in Industry 4.0 Data Using Machine Learning (2023)

Developed and implemented supervised (Random Forest, SVM) and unsupervised (Self-Organizing Maps, K-means) machine learning models to detect cyber intrusions in Industry 4.0 systems using telemetry data from IoT/IIoT sensors on Windows and Linux. The Random Forest model achieved **99.4% accuracy** on Windows 7 data, providing a robust approach for securing industrial systems.

### Silver Estimation Using Geostatistical Techniques for Peñasquito Breccia, Mexico (2023)

Applied **Ordinary and Simple Kriging** in **R** to estimate silver grades from a drill hole dataset of over 74,000 samples. Variograms and kriging maps revealed anisotropic mineral distribution. Results were validated with Leapfrog Edge, showing consistent spatial patterns. The project supported targeted exploration in silver-rich regions.

### Medical Image Denoising Using Total Variation and Convex Optimization (2023)

Used **MATLAB** to implement and compare **ADMM** and **Fast Gradient Projection (FGP)** for denoising MRI images affected by Gaussian noise. Evaluated performance using SSIM. Results showed ADMM performed better at lower noise levels (0.05), while both methods were comparable at higher levels (0.1). This study demonstrated the power of convex optimization in medical image reconstruction.

---

### Next Word Generation Using Markov Chain (2022)

Created a **Markov Chain model** to generate next-word predictions using cleaned and tokenized texts from *Macbeth*, *The Philosopher’s Stone*, and *Game of Thrones*. Calculated entropy and built a transition probability matrix (TPM) to analyze and simulate text flow. Demonstrated how statistical models can replicate natural language structure.

### NLP Project: Topic Modelling and Sentiment Prediction on Customer Reviews (2022)

Built multiple machine learning and deep learning models to analyze customer sentiment from product reviews. Achieved:
- **68.7% accuracy** with LSTM (5-class sentiment)
- **73.4% accuracy** with CNN+LSTM (3-class sentiment)
- **91.5% accuracy** with CNN (binary classification)  
Implemented in **Python**, the models convert qualitative feedback into quantitative insight for faster, data-driven decision-making.
